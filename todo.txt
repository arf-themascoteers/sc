bsdr oa aa k

first clasification

then add regression


when adding regression
==========================
to calculate RMSE - use real scale data

use of tag - refractor?

1. classification
2. regression
3. bsdr
4. multi
5. loss
6. diff datasets
7. analyze results - explanation

bsdr modific
-distance increase
variance? inverse l2?

meeting
=========
1. loss curve
2. loss equation (chain rule) - partial derivative


linear -> cubic spline

****
result accumulator
mso
cubic spline
relu instead of sigmoid
l1 l2?
mso

===

improve bsdr -> shortlist and then attention
improve bsdr -> 2x and then make them converge and pick top x (shapely?)
===================

regression
sigmoid -> relu
bsdr attn
with without dsc etc
multi
reasoning
plots
plots for loss etc

=====================
lucas -> bsdr shortlist -> run 1d-cnn
